# NodeJS-and-NestJS-Back-end-React-and-NextJS-Front-End

Part I: Front-End Development
React and Next.js Development (30 points):
Explain the main advantages of using Next.js alongside React and its suitability for server-rendering React applications.
Create a simple Next.js page that displays a greeting message.
Discuss Next.js routing and create a Next.js application with three different pages.
Demonstrate static and server-side rendering in Next.js.
Build a Next.js page that interacts with an API, displaying data fetched and providing functionality to filter or sort the results.
Create a dynamic route in Next.js and explain its functioning.
Part II: Back-End Development


Node.js and NestJS (50 points):
Create a simple Node.js server handling GET and POST requests.
Describe NestJS's main concepts and its advantages over plain Node.js, and create a basic NestJS application.
Extend the above application by adding a simple CRUD API for a single resource.
Implement basic authentication in the application.
2. PostgreSQL with TypeORM (30 points):

Explain TypeORM's role in managing database connections and operations, and its facilitation for PostgreSQL.
Create a basic PostgreSQL database schema using TypeORM.
Use TypeORM for basic CRUD operations on the designed database.

Part III: Algorithmic and Logic Questions (20%)


Array Transformation (10 points): Given an array of integers, perform the following transformation until all elements become 1: divide even elements by 2, and for odd elements, multiply by 3 and add 1. Write a function transformArray(arr) to implement this.
String Permutation (10 points): Given two strings, write a function checkPermutation(string1, string2) to check if one is a permutation of the other.
